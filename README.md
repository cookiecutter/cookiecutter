- [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/cookiecutter/)
- [License (BSD)](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter/blob/main/LICENSE)

## Installation

Install cookiecutter using pip package manager:
```
# pipx is strongly recommended.
pipx install cookiecutter

# If pipx is not available, install cookiecutter in your Python user directory using:
python -m pip install --user cookiecutter
```

## Features

- **Cross-Platform:** Supports Windows, Mac, and Linux.
- **User-Friendly:** No Python knowledge required.
- **Versatile:** Compatible with Python 3.8 to 3.12.

### For Users

#### Quick Start

The recommended way to use Cookiecutter as a command line utility is to run it with [`pipx`](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/), which can be installed with `pip install pipx`, but if you plan to use Cookiecutter programmatically, please run `pip install cookiecutter`.

**Use a GitHub template**

```bash
# You'll be prompted to enter values.
# Then it'll create your Python package in the current working directory,
# based on those values.
# For the sake of brevity, repos on GitHub can just use the 'gh' prefix
$ pipx run cookiecutter gh:audreyfeldroy/cookiecutter-pypackage
```

**Use a local template**

```bash
$ pipx run cookiecutter cookiecutter-pypackage/
```

**Use it from Python**

```py
from cookiecutter.main import cookiecutter

# Create project from the cookiecutter-pypackage/ template
cookiecutter('cookiecutter-pypackage/')

# Create project from the cookiecutter-pypackage.git repo template
cookiecutter('gh:audreyfeldroy//cookiecutter-pypackage.git')
```

#### Detailed Usage

- Generate projects from local or remote templates.
- Customize projects with `cookiecutter.json` prompts.
- Utilize pre-prompt, pre- and post-generate hooks.
