## 🔐 Reporting Security Issues

> Do not open issues that might have security implications!
> It is critical that security related issues are reported privately so we have time to address them before they become public knowledge.

Vulnerabilities can be reported by emailing core members:

- python-project [hello@python-project.com](mailto:hello@python-project.com)

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Environment (e.g. Linux / Windows / macOS)
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.
