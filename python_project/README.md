Awesome `python-project` is a Python cli/package created with https://github.com/Undertone0809/python-package-template

</div>

## Quick start

Conda package manager is recommended. Create a conda environment.

```bash
conda create -n python-project python==3.10
```

Activate conda environment and install poetry

```bash
conda activate python-project
pip install poetry
```

Then you can run the client using the following command:

```bash
python-project --help
```

or with `Poetry`:

```bash
poetry run python-project --help
```

### Makefile usage

[`Makefile`](https://github.com/python_project/python-project/blob/main/Makefile) contains a lot of functions for faster development.


<details>
<summary>Install all dependencies and pre-commit hooks</summary>
<p>

Install requirements:

```bash
make install
```

Pre-commit hooks coulb be installed after `git init` via

```bash
make pre-commit-install
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Codestyle and type checks</summary>
<p>

Automatic formatting uses `ruff`.

```bash
make format
```

Codestyle checks only, without rewriting files:

```bash
make check-codestyle
```

> Note: `check-codestyle` uses `ruff` and `darglint` library

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Code security</summary>
<p>

> If this command is not selected during installation, it cannnot be used.

```bash
make check-safety
```

This command launches `Poetry` integrity checks as well as identifies security issues with `Safety` and `Bandit`.

```bash
make check-safety
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Tests with coverage badges</summary>
<p>

Run `pytest`

```bash
make test
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>All linters</summary>
<p>

Of course there is a command to run all linters in one:

```bash
make lint
```

the same as:

```bash
make check-codestyle && make test && make check-safety
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Docker</summary>
<p>

```bash
make docker-build
```

which is equivalent to:

```bash
make docker-build VERSION=latest
```

Remove docker image with

```bash
make docker-remove
```

More information [about docker](https://github.com/Undertone0809/python-package-template/tree/main/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.project_name%20%7D%7D/docker).

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Cleanup</summary>
<p>
Delete pycache files

```bash
make pycache-remove
```

Remove package build

```bash
make build-remove
```

Delete .DS_STORE files

```bash
make dsstore-remove
```

Remove .mypycache

```bash
make mypycache-remove
```

Or to remove all above run:

```bash
make cleanup
```
